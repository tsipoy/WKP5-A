# Wiring up Onja Cookbook

### I hardly succeed to code this project, I always need help from the others.  

### I couldn't manage to meet some of the requirement such as: 
- I couldn't display a list in the ingradients and steps. It was a bit hard to read them.
- I also couldn't change the picture of the foods. It only works withe picture that you had set before.
- I couldn't manage to make the form to work. It did appear in the browser but it still did nothing.

### Improvements:
- If I had more time, I would continue to add list in the ingredients and the steps. So, they would be easy to read.
- Additionally, I would like continuing the form so, I would be able to make a new card from it.
